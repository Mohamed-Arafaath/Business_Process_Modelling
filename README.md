Project Title:
Business Process Modeling Analysis of Online Music Store Purchases Using BPMN and Petri Nets

Motivation:
The project motivation was to analyze the execution process of a purchase in an online music store, focusing on providing options for choosing and removing goods from a shopping cart, checking out, and logging out during the purchase.

1. Introduction:
   - Provided an overview of the project and its objectives.
   - Discussed the importance of analyzing the execution process of a purchase in an online music store.

2. Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) and Petri Nets:
   - Discussed the use of BPMN and Petri nets in modeling the system.
   - Provided an overview of the two modeling techniques and their advantages in analyzing complex systems.

3. Primary Process of the Music Store:
   - Focused on the primary process of the music store, involving customer logging in and browsing the catalog.
   - Discussed the decision-making process for user identification and management of user credentials within the system.

4. BPMN Model with Two Pools and a Variant with Three Pools:
   - Discussed the development of the BPMN model with two pools and a variant with three pools.
   - Highlighted issues related to choreography between the pools and communication flow.

5. Petri Nets for the Customer, Music Store, and Shopping Cart:
   - Discussed the development of Petri nets for the customer, music store, and shopping cart.
   - Addressed challenges related to the connection between the three pools and implications for the workflow system's properties.

Conclusion:
The conclusion emphasized the need for a better choreography to address the identified problems and highlighted the limitations in inferring the soundness and safeness of the system. It also provided a summary of the report's findings and their implications for future research.
